# 👋 Hi, I'm Francisca Muñoz!

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Francisca Muñoz, an industrial engineer and data enthusiast. I have experience with Python, R, and SQL, as well as data visualization tools such as Power BI and Tableau.

Originally from Chile, I have been living in Arizona since 2022. I love Chilean geography and food and miss them dearly. However, Arizona has pleasantly surprised me because each place is so different from the next. You can go from the desert near Tucson to the forest of the White Mountains, and then to Sedona, which I think is the most beautiful place in the state with its red rocks and special mysticism.

I hope to use my recently acquired skills to help my future team achieve its objectives.
